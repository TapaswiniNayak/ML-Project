NATO PHONETIC ALPHABET

This code is a program that translates letters and numbers into their corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet equivalents. 
The NATO phonetic alphabet is a standard set of words used to represent each letter and number to ensure clear communication in situations like radio transmissions.

The program allows the user to either provide the input as command-line arguments or enter it interactively. 
Once the input is obtained, each character is looked up in a dictionary that maps it to its NATO phonetic alphabet representation. 
The program then prints each character along with its corresponding NATO translation.

For example, if the input is "hello123", the program will output:
h Hotel   |  ****
e Echo    |  *
l Lima    |  *-**
l Lima    |  *-**
o Oscar   |  ---
1 One (Pronounce as Wun)    |  *----
2 Two (Pronounce as Too)    |  **---
3 Three (Pronounce as Tree) |  ***--
